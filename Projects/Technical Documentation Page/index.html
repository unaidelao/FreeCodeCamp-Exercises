                        The actions that a program takes are expressed in
                        statements. Common actions include declaring variables,
                        assigning values, calling methods, looping through
                        collections, and branching to one or another block of
                        code, depending on a given condition. The order in which
                        statements are executed in a program is called the flow
                        of control or flow of execution. The flow of control may
                        vary every time that a program is run, depending on how
                        the program reacts to input that it receives at run
                        time.

                        A statement can consist of a single line of code that
                        ends in a semicolon, or a series of single-line
                        statements in a block. A statement block is enclosed in
                        {} brackets and can contain nested blocks. The following
                        code shows two examples of single-line statements, and a
                        multi-line statement block:

                    <p>
                        An expression is a sequence of one or more operands and
                        zero or more operators that can be evaluated to a single
                        value, object, method, or namespace. Expressions can
                        consist of a literal value, a method invocation, an
                        operator and its operands, or a simple name. Simple
                        names can be the name of a variable, type member, method
                        parameter, namespace or type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expressions can use operators that in turn use other
                        expressions as parameters, or method calls whose
                        parameters are in turn other method calls, so
                        expressions can range from simple to very complex.
                        Following are two examples of expressions:

                    <header>Operators</header>
                    <p>
                        In C#, an operator is a program element that is applied
                        to one or more operands in an expression or statement.
                        Operators that take one operand, such as the increment
                        operator <code class="small-code">(++)</code> or
                        <code class="small-code">new</code>, are referred to as
                        unary operators. Operators that take two operands, such
                        as arithmetic operators
                        <code class="small-code">(+,-,*,/)</code>, are referred
                        to as binary operators. One operator, the conditional
                        operator <code class="small-code">(?:)</code>, takes
                        three operands and is the sole ternary operator in C#.
                        The following C# statement contains a single unary
                        operator and a single operand. The increment operator,
                        <code class="small-code">++</code>, modifies the value
                        of the operand <code class="small-code">y</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following C# statement contains two binary
                        operators, each with two operands. The assignment
                        operator,
                        <code class="small-code">=</code>>, has the integer
                        variable <code class="small-code">y</code> and the
                        expression <code class="small-code">2 + 3</code> as
                        operands. The expression
                        <code class="small-code">2 + 3</code> itself consists of
                        the addition operator and two operands, 2 and 3.
                    </p>
                    <code class="large-code">y = 2 + 3;</code>
                    <p>
                        An operand can be a valid expression that is composed of
                        any length of code, and it can comprise any number of
                        sub expressions. In an expression that contains multiple
                        operators, the order in which the operators are applied
                        is determined by operator precedence, associativity, and
                        parentheses.

                        You can store multiple variables of the same type in an
                        array data structure. You declare an array by specifying

                        A string is an object of type String whose value is
                        text. Internally, the text is stored as a sequential
                        read-only collection of Char objects. There is no
                        null-terminating character at the end of a C# string;
                        therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded
                        null characters ('\0'). The Length property of a string
                        represents the number of
                        <code class="small-code">Char</code> objects it
                        contains, not the number of Unicode characters. To
                        access the individual Unicode code points in a string,
                        use the StringInfo object.

                        You can declare and initialize strings in various ways,
                        as shown in the following example:
